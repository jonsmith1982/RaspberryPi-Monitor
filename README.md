## CPU Load (%)

It shows a Guage style graph show the current load under each CPU core you may have on your Raspberry Pi in terms of percentage.

## CPU Temperature

A view of the current core temperature is always visible so you know when you may be coming close to its recommended limits.

## Memory Usage

Memory usage is displayed in a process chart showing the percentage your Raspberry Pi is currently implementing. A break down of what the memory may be being used for will be implemented in future releases.
